- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why? I have decided to overload the constructor.  I decided to make one who takes only the name and another one who takes in the name and the adress. I choosed the constructed because I think that, many factors can influence the creation of a building . A building can be recognise by it's name despite the fact that it may not have an exact adress known as well as by its name and the adress. By that, I make it possible for a person to create a building knowing its name and not the adress or knowing the both but not the number of floors and the rest. 

-What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?  The work wasn't so difficult for me but at the beginning, I was afraid of what will it contain. AAn advice I can give is not to build barriers in our heads before doing the work because if we want to do, we can.
